  "desc_blood": "When there is a problem with the kidneys, ureters, or bladder, red blood cells are mixed in the urine. To check for occult blood in the urine, apply urine to a test paper and test. ",
  "desc_bilirubin": "Bilirubin is a component of bile and is made from hemoglobin.\nIt circulates through the blood vessels for about 3 weeks, supplying oxygen, and then it is destroyed. At this time, hemoglobin is metabolized and transformed into bilirubin.",
  "desc_urobilnogen": "The form of bilirubin that is created when red blood cells are destroyed and converted by intestinal bacteria is called urobilirugen.",

  "desc_gravity": "This is an important test item that measures the concentration of urine. Specific gravity of urine is a value that compares the density of urine to the density of water, reflecting the amount of substances dissolved in urine, and plays an important role in evaluating the function and hydration of the kidneys.",
  "desc_leukocytes": "It refers to the presence of white blood cells in urine.\nThey play a role in protecting the body from bacterial infections or inflammatory reactions.\nIf white blood cells are found in a urine test, this can mainly be a sign of urinary tract infections (UTIs) or kidney disease.",
